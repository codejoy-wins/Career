            <h1>My Career Story</h1>

            <h2>Pinkberry</h2>
            
            <p>
            
            I will begin with my first job.  I was 15 or 16 in high school and my parents told me to get a part time job.  I walked into Pinkberry, shook hands with the manager across the counter, and had my first job on my first try.  
            
            </p>
            
            <p>
            
            I was unable to make smoothies and my coworkers would do it for me and let me do the easy job of serving your yogurt. 
            
            </p>
            
            <p> The only thing I needed to worry about was a secret shopper.  One day a secret shopper came in a wrote a review of my service and I was able to read it.  It noted how I left a big vacancy of yogurt at the bottom aka was not good at the one thing I was supposed to do.  However, it also noted how I said thank you several times and was super friendly and helpful.  I thought maybe I’d have a future in customer service.  
            
            </p>
            
            <p>
            
            My time at Pinkberry ended when I saw the manager who hired me and who I liked a lot, open their paycheck and walk off in frustration.  She did everything.  You know the pareto principle or whatever? 20% of the people do 80% of the work?  100% true and they didn’t pay her overtime she was promised so she walked out mid-shift, I never saw her again, and I realized she had deemed the work not worth the effort.  I agreed, and saw no value in the job other than getting my parents off my back.  Then I went on vacation, didn’t tell them, missed my shift and got fired.  I was young.
            
            </p>
            
            <h2>Focusing on School</h2>
            
            <p>
            
            After seeing how things worked at my first job, I decided to avoid work like the plague.  I somehow convinced my parents to let me focus on school and not work.  I got straight A’s, an SAT score above 2000, and they bought me a car.
            
            Then I got into UCSC, and wasn’t going to have to work while in school.
            
            
            
            </p>
            
            
            
            <h2>Weld Logic </h2>
            
            
            
            <p>  Before leaving for college, I got a summer job at my dad’s friends welding company.  They promised me $15/hr.  I got in on the first day and the guy said he was going to offer me $11.50, higher than normal starting wage.  I said $15 or no deal, and they gave it to me.
            
            
            
            Because they were paying me more than my coworkers they had me run a high tech welding machine which I handled easily.  Then they also had me do some other welding that required protective eye wear, but they didn’t have enough protective eye wear so they gave me a sliver of glass or something as protection and I was supposed to manually hold it over my face during times of danger.  
            
            
            
            One time while welding I forgot to guard my eyes, looked at the light and was blinded.  I cannot see well anymore.  I wear glasses now.  I had perfect vision.  I have no proof and no interest in suing my dad’s friend for getting hurt in a job I didn’t deserve!
            
            
            
            I decided work sucks.  They could pay me $10000000 and it wouldn’t be worth my damn eye.  
            
            
            
            I decided I needed to forever stay away from putting my physical body on the line at work.  I want to monetize my mind instead.
            
            
            
            </p>
            
            
            
            <h2>Santa Cruz : Part One</h2>
            
             
            
            <p> Then I went to Santa Cruz.  I had a girlfriend and was very happy the first year.  I was focused on getting with a college girl and having fun.  I did not care about my classes other than as a way to get out of work.  I targeted easy classes like low-level chemistry so my parents would see the A and think I’m doing well when really I belong in upper-upper level science.  I didn’t even take the math placement exam because I had no intention of taking math even though I have an aptitude for it.  I didn’t think it was worth it.  I was all about minimal effort with maximum reward.  I was missing the fundamental truth of men, which is that soft times make a man soft.  The harder we push ourselves, the more our body and mind excel. It's counter-intuitive, but avoiding a steep hill will not make you any better off.  The person who goes up the steep hill will become better at climbing than you.  Better at breathing.  Just by doing what is difficult.
            </p>
            
            <p>I did not know this.  I had the wisdom of a pinky finger.  I got broken up with and failed out of school because I became someone trying to live the easy life instead of going towards difficulty which is what I had unknowingly done in order to get the girl and the college in the first place.  I kayaked around a lake once a day with my shirt off, worked out, and did all my homework every day for a year my Junior Year of High School to have the Senior Year I always wanted.</p>
            
            <h2>College Dropout</h2>
            
            
            <p>Now all of the sudden my parents are off the table.  They're mad at me for failing out of college.  Understandable.  They tell me to get a job.  I can barely function at this point because I was going through so much change and anxiety.  I got a job at Jamba Juice locally because the girl who worked there knew me from high school.  I was terrible at Jamba Juice for the first several months.  I felt so embarrassed and dysfunctional.  My boss who hired me didn't say anything until later when the work had gotten me somewhat functional again.   I actually became somewhat comfortable at work and was a good cashier, still bad at making smoothies, and good at customer service, just like my first job.  In other words, I made zero career progress and gained zero education since high school. I worked at Jamba Juice for a year and I liked that job now that I think of it but the noises of the Blender's and the Music, and the smells were a little too much.  Anyway, I remember attending a conference and it felt good to belong.  I answered a question with a correct answer but I didn't feel valued or see any opportunity for advancement.  Since I was doing okay again, and I still hadn't given up on my college dream, I enrolled at Moorpark Community College.  My mom said I should only do one class at a time considering the mental breakdown I had.  I agreed and started taking Critical Thinking and Composition at Moorpark College.  There was a final essay about whether or not facebook is good for you.  It took me a year to write.  I got an incomplete, but then later turned it to a B.  During that strange time, I moved to Moorpark to be closer to my classes.  I failed college because I didn't go to class.  Once I'm in class, I pass.  But In moving to Moorpark, I kept my old job at the jamba in westlake, and had to commute now, instead of working at the Moorpark Jamba.  In retrospect, this was stupid, but I was insecure and afraid of Moorpark.  I wanted to keep my exact job with my boss that liked me.  I ended up getting fired one morning for being late by catching traffic on the way to work.  That's the longest I've ever held down any position.  And it was one year.  </p>
            
            <p>In the meantime, my parents were pissed.  I mean, taking one class and getting an incomplete?  It might have been a couple classes, I don't remember all the details.  But this story is about my experiences with work in life.  So here is a time where my parents are down on me, and I need to provide for myself by turning to the working world, but the working world was not kind to me.  This is the time frame in my life when I realized how hard it was to earn money and how useless I am to these companies.  I realized how bad the job market looked for someone like me, a college dropout with no work experience or skills.</p>
            
            <p>I had skills.  I thought I was the greatest call of duty player in the world and I probably was up there, honestly.  I was a singer-songwriter trying to get my girl back over the internet -- didn't work.  My parents took away my video games and I had to find another outlet for that desire I had to win at something. So I got into chess.  I got really into chess.  Became obsessed.  Now I'm not obsessed, but I'm randomly insanely good at chess.  I can put a number to it: it's about 1750.  1800 is tournament-level.  Then I started searching for jobs in chess.  I called a guy on Craigslist and told him I wanted to be a chess teacher.  He hired me on the phone because I was willing to let him go and just friendly about my genuine interest in the opportunity.  He literally fired the other chess coach in my area and gave me the job.  This is because I had real skill and passion in the subject.  It was for the first time in my life, the right job for me.  It's weird that we pay for our whole lives off of one skill, but we have so many others.  How many earning potentials are limited by choosing the wrong skill to earn money with?  How successful would Einstein have been if he could only make money fighting in UFC?  You know?  I needed to find my strength.  </p>
            
            <h2>Educhess & Coast to Coast Computer Products</h2>
            
            <p>All of the Sudden, I'm teaching chess for $30/hr, and he's paying me $50/hr because I'm doing such a great job.  It was insanely fun and I showed up early and stayed late.  The only problem about this job was that it wasn't enough hours.  Now that I think of it... I started off at this time in a job at Coast to Coast Computer Products.  I needed fulltime for the money.  I convinced this guy I could be a salesman.  He told me not to try to sell to the Virgin Islands.  I called them anyway and made my only sale.  This job was dreadful.  I was literally a telemarketer.  I would get cussed out. I eventually decided I did not care if they fired me and I just collected my paycheck until they did.  They called me in to the office and said, "you know we can hear you on the phone right?"  and I said, "Look, I don't want to be paid anything I didn't earn."  I'll never forget the guy who hired me, trying to capitalize on that to his boss lady, who was paying me out of his salary or something, and she just let me leave and paid me full.  During this horrible job, it occured to me to make money doing something I loved, instead of hated like selling printer cartridges, so I searched for "chess" on craigslist and just called whoever I could.  It worked.   I was living at my friends house during this time because my parents were made about my incomplete.  I ended up getting the writing requirement satisfied when he changed my grade though.</p>
            
            
            <h2>Apple One Data Entry</h2>
            
            <p>Now the getting back into school thing has failed, so I have to pay for my own life.  I go to a temp agency becaues I had heard my friend got a good job there.  I thought he was cool so if I could do that same job my life would be alright, and it was!  I was bad at the job as always but I made a lot of money by my standards.   I was working fulltime and it wasn't telemarketing.  It was data entry.  A little bit better.  But still, too much monotony for me.  On my break, I started to miss writing things down with pencil, and solving math problems or writing essays.  I missed girls my age in my class and social gatherings.  Real life was just not as fun as school for me.  So I called my academic advisor at UC Santa Cruz and asked what I needed to do exactly to get back in and finish what I started.   She told me I never declared a major at UCSC and that I needed to before returning for a 3rd year.  The only option was Philosophy.  I was closest to those requirements because that's what I thought I might do because it was the only thing I thought was different from high school.  You can't take Philosophy in high school so I was intrigued and still am.  Part of the requirements she gave me were to also to take fulltime coursework at another university and get all B's or better to demonstrate recovery. At the time, I was taking one class at a time that had no real plan towards a major.  But I made it work, and they ended up admitting me even though I got a C in French because I told them I could have gotten a B in something I already knew, but I thought I'd try to learn French.  Learning a language is really hard.  If a computer programming language than that explains its difficulty to grasp.    </p>
            
            <h2>Santa Cruz: Part Two</h2>
            
            <p>
                My roommate my senior year was a computer science major.  Young wiz kid making $25/hr and I was making $0/hr.  My favorite class in college was computer science and I got an A but I was really just trying to coast and not get into anything difficult.  I used college as a vacation and if I could do it over again I would be much more serious in my studies.  After graduation, I've been studying math like crazy.  Education is a gift, and you don't know til it's gone.  At the same time, I knew then, that I would be a computer programmer.  $25/hr to work on the computer is good enough for me.  So next time I need money, that's what I'll do, I told myself.
            </p>
            
            <h2>College Grad : The Return of the Prodigal Son</h2>
            
            <p>After graduating college, I wanted to chill.  See a pattern here?  Anyway I had no intention of getting a job and every intention of taking advantage of my new status as a college graduate.  Pretty soon my Mom was fed up and told me to get a job.  I went through the painful process of again realizing how infantesimal my value was in the workforce.  I mean I can write, in theory, because of a philosophy degree, really what I can do is talk.  I can just talk with the absolute best of them.  I went back to AppleOne and tried to get my old job back and they actually gave it to me, but not a lot of hours and again, I wasn't particularly good at that job anyway.  So I started working as a waiter at the Four Seasons through Apple One.  I forgot to mention I worked at several restaurants after my dropout of college and never felt adequate enough to be a waiter.   I hated all of those jobs in the service industry.  If you're in the service industry, get out.  It's really that simple. My contact at AppleOne hated me, and one time put me on an assignment with someone who really didn't like my attitude on my first day of work and told her that but all I could think about on the job was how ineffecient the entire system was, rather than focus on my specific task.  I was also very against risking injury. It all fell through after the Four Seasons realized I was a terrible employee, who didn't know where anything was.  I have a highly analytical mind and amazing memory but I am not in the same 3D spacetime as you and I have almost zero directional ability because I think in a different way.  I'm pretty confident my brain thinks about directions fundamentally differently from other people.  I have all sorts of weaknesses and strengths and it's important to me to find a career that rewards those strengths instead of punishing them.  I once was fired from a sandwich shop because they told me I should be a data analyst.  That really happened.  I was only concerned with the menu and how everyone who worked there ate things off the menu.  I'm like, "put it on the damn menu! None of you eat the menu.  Ridiculous." I'm a big picture guy. </p>
            
            <h2>Mathnasium</h2>
            
            <p>Then I did some reflecting on all my past jobs.  When was I happiest?  How many hours do I need?  Which jobs do I think have dignity?  I decided to pursue video game design but obviously couldn't get my foot in the door so I started to teach myself math.  From Scratch.  This is a plan I came up with during college but didn't implement until after.  So I studied math fulltime for about a few months and then I took a test at Mathnasium to be an Instructor, a test I had previously failed, and I passed it and became an instructor.  I'm technically still an instructor.  I love math! I love kids!  Teaching math is an awesome, awesome, job. However teachers are underpaid and I'm much more interested in computer science anyways.  I am happy with Mathnasium because it's for a good cause, no one cussing me out cause I'm a telemarketer, and because it's good for my brain to practice what I'm bad at by teaching it.</p>
            
            
            <h2>Coding Dojo</h2>
            
            <p>Then my dad noticed how well I was doing and we started looking into Coding Bootcamps to accelerate the learning I was doing on my own.  Khanacademy taught me math but also introduced me to Javascript and Web Design.  I moved to Burbank, graduated from the bootcamp, got interviewed by Google and Amazon, and even a game company, but failed each and every interview, although close on the Google one, and now I'd ace the game design one.  - It was make a 2d game in 2 hours with Samus's gun from Super Smash, so it has to charge up.  I couldn't do it.  Now I could.  During the Dojo is when I started teaching myself game design because I didn't like the ending of their curricullum just doing the same stuff.  No spell check here, guys.  In an IDE.   I am currently searching for my first programming job and preparing for interviews, working on personal projects, and seeking advice.  Given my career, I think the next logical steps are to get a web dev position, then try to get into games.  Correct me if I'm wrong. </p>

            <h2>Technical Interviews</h2>

            <p>Quick note on the Google interview:  They said "find and remove the least unique set in a set of sets".  Now, I imagine this is important to figure out because then you can change something without anyone noticing, like compression.  I was in a good state of mind, and I took a stab at the question, but something really interesting happened.  He only cared about how my mind worked.  He didn't care about my CS knowledge.  Let's say you have a funciton DoSomething();  he didn't care what it did, just that I knew how it worked together in a larger function.  So the hard part of the question was making parts work together when you don't understand them seperately.  So you can imagine solving a prime factorization algo where in order to solve it you need to have a prime() function that just finds out if it's prime or not.  During the interview, the important part is what to do with the prime funciton in order to solve the main question.  Does that make sense?  Anyway, it was too hard for me to do on the spot.  I solved the algorithm after he got off the phone and I calmed down.  I was so worried about him liking me, or me seeming knowledgable that I forgot the main point which is that Google is just casting fishing lines out there for the smartest people and to get the job you have to demonstrate that moreso than any specific knowledge.  It's more about general problem solving strategies that are clever.  I could be way off, but that was my takeaway from the interview and I look forward to my second try.  Amazon asked me not to share their interview questions. </p>
            
            <h1>The End</h1>
            <h3>I hope you liked my career story.  I was watching a GDC talk about weird jobs in the game industry and he said we all have a unique career path that's like a story.  So I'm detailing mine.  Thank you.</h3>
